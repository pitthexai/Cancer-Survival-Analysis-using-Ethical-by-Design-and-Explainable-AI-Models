### Abstract
<p align="justify">Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to demonstrate substantial potential in predictive oncology, yet clinical translation demands models that are transparent, robust, and ethically aligned. This study presents an ethical-by-design and explainable AI framework for cancer survival analysis using the large-scale, population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) dataset. Our computational strategy integrates stage-stratified modeling with social and environmental determinants of health to enable context-aware survival prediction across ten major cancer types. We trained and validated multiple machine learning (ML) models incorporating both clinical features and contextual indices, including the Yost Index (YOST), Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and Air Quality Index (AQI). To promote fairness, an Equalized Odds constraint was applied during ML training and evaluation, building more equitable performance across patient subgroups. Model-agnostic explainability techniques, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), provided global and patient-level interpretability, revealing clinically coherent and biologically admissible attribution patterns. The proposed trustworthy AI framework achieved strong predictive performance across cancer types and stages while improving parity among demographic and socioeconomic groups. Collectively, this work introduces a scalable, interpretable, and fairness-aware paradigm for cancer survival modeling that advances safe and clinically meaningful AI development in oncology.
